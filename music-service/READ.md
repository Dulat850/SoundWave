Project Proposal
Music Streaming Service (Spotify-like)
Project Title

SoundWave – Music Streaming Service

1. Project Overview & Relevance

Music streaming services have become the primary way people listen to music today. Platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music offer large music libraries but are often overloaded with complex features, advertisements, and recommendation systems that may confuse users or distract them from the core purpose — listening to music.

The goal of this project is to design a simple and lightweight music streaming service that focuses on core functionality such as browsing music, managing playlists, and playing tracks. The project is intended as an educational software system that demonstrates backend architecture, data modeling, and modular design using the Go programming language.

This project is relevant because it reflects a real-world system while remaining manageable in scope for an academic environment.

2. Target Users

The target users of the system are:

University students

Young users who prefer minimalistic applications

Users who want a simple music service without complex recommendations

The system is not intended to replace commercial platforms but to demonstrate how such systems are designed and structured.

3. Competitor Analysis

Several popular music streaming services already exist:

Spotify

Pros: Large music library, advanced recommendations

Cons: Advertisements in free version, complex interface

Apple Music

Pros: High audio quality, integration with Apple ecosystem

Cons: Subscription required, limited cross-platform flexibility

YouTube Music

Pros: Free access, large content base

Cons: Less focus on structured playlists and albums

Our solution differs by focusing on:

Simplicity and clarity

Core music functionality only

Clean backend architecture suitable for educational purposes

4. Planned Features

At this stage, only planned features are defined. UI design and detailed workflows are intentionally excluded.

User Features

User registration and authentication

Browse music by artist and album

Search for tracks

Play music tracks

Create and manage playlists

Add and remove tracks from playlists

Mark tracks as favorites

Admin Features

Add, update, and delete artists

Add, update, and delete albums

Add, update, and delete tracks

5. Project Scope

The project will be implemented as a monolithic backend application written in Go.
It will focus on:

Clear separation of responsibilities (handlers, services, repositories)

Proper data modeling

Scalability for future extensions

Frontend implementation and advanced features such as recommendation algorithms are outside the scope of this milestone.

6. Conclusion

The proposed music streaming service is a realistic and relevant project that demonstrates understanding of software architecture, backend development, and system design. The project is suitable for incremental development and fulfills the requirements of the Advanced Programming 1 course milestone.
